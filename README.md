Group Project For Data Management Course: Google Playstore Database Creation and Analysis

## The original data source is obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps). The data was collected in April 2019 by Gautham Prakash and  Jithin Koshy. We consider this data as an important one as it records details of all applications published in Google Play store by April 2019. The mobile application is playing a more and more important role in various industries. Evaluating this dataset may help future app developers build a better understanding of the market.
